project:
  title: "Water Quality Prediction"
  domain: "Environmental Analytics / Water Quality Monitoring"
  description: >
    A machine learning approach to predict water potability and forecast pH variations
    using open-source datasets and ensemble models. The project combines classification
    (potable vs. non-potable) and regression (pH forecasting) to support
    data-driven water quality monitoring in the Kurukshetra region.
